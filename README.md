# Hands-On-Deck Application

This document will serve as the starting point for the development of the volunteer tracker application.

## How to get started

Clone the repository to your computer using the following command on Linux:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/themennice/hands-on-deck.git
```

Wait until the repository is cloned and change directory into the cloned repo:

```
$ cd hands-on-deck
```

Check that the repos was cloned correctly by executing the first line:

```
$ git remote -v   
origin	https://github.com/themennice/hands-on-deck.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/themennice/hands-on-deck.git (push)
```
If everything matches, start working as normal using:

```
$ git add [file_name]
$ git commit -m "your message goes here"
$ git push origin master
```
